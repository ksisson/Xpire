### Xpire
Xpire is a web application for tracking the shelflife of refrigerated goods.

Create an account and keep track of expiration dates on perishable foods by logging them into our database. 

Simply type the name of your food into our search bar and press submit. We will use our database to try to provide you with an expiration date for your food item and add it to your list. If we cannot find your food in our database, you will be prompted to estimate the shelflife and we will calculate the expiration date from there. Login each day to see a list of all the items in your fridge with the items expiring sooner at the top.

Once you consume an item or it expires (hopefully we're helping you avoid this), press the minus button to delete it from your list.

Enjoy!
